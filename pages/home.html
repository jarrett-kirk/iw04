        <h2>Welcome</h2><br>
        <p>Welcome to the LFSR Learning Hub, your go-to resource for exploring the fascinating world of Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) in cryptography and cybersecurity. Our mission is to demystify this powerful cryptographic tool and provide an engaging learning experience. In the field of cryptography, visuals and friendly learning materials can be hard to come by. Our motivation is to bridge this gap and empower students and enthusiasts to grasp the concepts of LFSRs with ease.</p>
